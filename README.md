# Extensive Form Games

## Features
- Specify multi-player extensive form games as tree structures, with potentially imperfect information
  * Convert from extensive form to normal (strategic) form games
  * Convert from extensive form to sequence form games
- Compute correlated equilibria using linear programming techniques 
  * Simplex
  * Lemke-Howlson
- Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
  * Weighted Majority
  * Perturbed Follow-the-Leader
  * Regularized Follow-the-Leader 

## ~~Coming Soon in Feb. 2020~~ TBD
+ Compute correlated equilibria using counterfactual regret minimization algorithms
