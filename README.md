# Extensive Form Games

## Features
This is repository currently features the following functionality:
+ Specify multi-player extensive form games as tree structures, with potentially imperfect information
+ Convert from extensive form to normal (strategic) form games
+ Convert from extensive form to sequence form games
+ Compute correlated equilibria using linear programming techniques

## To Be Ported
+ Compute correlated equilibria using counterfactual regret minimization algorithms
